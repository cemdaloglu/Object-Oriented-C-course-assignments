with const int** one expects a pointer to a pointer to a constant int. The thing is, that the second pointer is not constant, which makes it possible to change the constant the pointer chain is pointing to.
Second does not compile because, we try to assign bar(), which is an const int*, to int *, through which the elements that bar() promised would not be changed could be changed.
